# numpy_tasks

Q1) State differences between Numpy Array and lists.

Q2) Write a Code to create 50 evenly spaced numbers between 0 to 10.

Q3) Write a Code to create an array of shape (4,5) with random samples
with random seed 7.

Q4) Write a Code to reshape the array created in Q3 into shape (2,10).

Q5) Create a 1D array starting from 0 ending with 100 with step size 10 and
another array starting from 1000 ending with 10000 with step size 1000 and
then concatenate two arrays created.

Q6) Use the array created in Q5 and replace the values less than 50 as
<50.

Q7) Write a Code to create 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays randomly.

Q8) Write a Code to create an array with 10 random integers within 100.

Q9) Create an array with sample data with a shape of (5,4) with standard
normal distribution with the random seed of 201.

Q10) Use the array from Q9 and create a Dataframe with
index=['L','M','N','O','P'], columns=['A','B','C','D']

Q11) Find the most frequent value in an numpy 1D array. Use array x =
np.array([10,20,66,20,10,30,50,60,70,60,66,12,13,66]).
